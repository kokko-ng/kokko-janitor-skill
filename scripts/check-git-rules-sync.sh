# Verify the shared git-safety-core block stays byte-identical across the
# janitor, multipass, and design skills. All three brief subagents with the
# same non-negotiable git rules on purpose; deliberate per-skill deltas
# (push policy, nothing-found rules) live OUTSIDE the markers. Unenforced,
# the copies drift -- one skill banned `git clean`, another did not -- and
# deliberate deltas become indistinguishable from accidents. Mirrors
# check-skill-sync.sh in kokko-skills, which holds the reference mechanism.
