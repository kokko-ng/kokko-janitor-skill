description: Judge whether a module is a god module and produce (or apply) a gated split plan. Use when the user asks whether a file should be split, mentions a god module, god class, oversized module, or hotspot, or wants a refactoring plan for one specific module. Pass the path of the module to judge; add --apply to execute the plan behind gates.

# Design Check Skill

Judge one module flagged by deterministic hotspot metrics. Deterministic
tools can rank candidates but cannot tell a legitimately large orchestrator
from a god module — that judgment is this skill's job. The output is a
verdict and, for god modules, a concrete split plan. Report-only by
default; `--apply` executes the plan behind strict gates.

## Input

- `<module-path>` - the file to judge
- Metric evidence in the invoking prompt (LOC, defs, fan-in/out, churn,
  score, temporal-coupling partners). If absent, run:
  `python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/hotspots.py" . --top 20`
  and extract this module's row.

## Step 1: Understand the Module

Read the ENTIRE module — no sampling. Then read a representative sample of
its importers (3-5 files) to see how it is actually used. Identify:

- The distinct responsibilities present (name each in one line)
- Which functions/classes belong to which responsibility
- Shared state or helpers that couple the responsibilities together
- The public API: what importers actually use, vs what is internal

## Step 2: Verdict

**`cohesive`** — one responsibility, or responsibilities so entangled that
splitting adds indirection without clarity. Size alone is not a defect: a
large module with one clear job is fine. Report the verdict with one
paragraph of reasoning and STOP. This outcome is common and correct —
never invent a split to justify the invocation.

**`god-module`** — two or more separable responsibilities, evidenced by:

- Disjoint groups of functions sharing no helpers or state across groups
- Importers that each use only one slice of the module
- The metric evidence corroborating (high fan-in from unrelated packages,
  churn from unrelated features touching the same file)

## Step 3: Split Plan (god-module only)

Before writing any plan file, make sure `.janitor/` is ignored in the
TARGET repo — its own `.gitignore` almost certainly does not cover it,
and an unignored plan file dirties the tree, which collides with the
orchestrator's clean-tree checks. Append to `.git/info/exclude`
(non-invasive: never touch the target's tracked `.gitignore`):

```bash
# --git-path resolves to the shared info/exclude even inside a worktree
git check-ignore -q .janitor/probe 2>/dev/null || \
  echo '.janitor/' >> "$(git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude)"
```

Then write `.janitor/design-plan-<module-stem>.md` (relative to the repo
root of the worktree; create `.janitor/` if needed):

- **Responsibilities found**, one line each
- **Proposed modules**: name, responsibility, exact list of
  functions/classes that move there
- **Public API preservation**: the original module remains and re-exports
  everything importers use today, so NO importer changes in this pass and
  the external surface is byte-identical
- **Shared internals**: where coupled helpers/state go, and why
- **Risk notes**: import cycles the split could create, test coverage of
  the moved code, anything the judges should scrutinize

Do not edit any source file in report-only mode. The plan file itself is
the ONE permitted untracked artifact of a report-only run: with the
`.git/info/exclude` entry above in place, `.janitor/` plan files are
ignored, do not count as a dirty tree, and must never be committed or
deleted to "clean up" — the orchestrator collects them.

## Step 4: Apply (only with `--apply`)

Gates, in order — a failed gate means STOP, report, do not proceed:

1. **Coverage gate**: measure test coverage of this module. Below 70%,
   first write characterization tests capturing current observed behavior
   (inputs/outputs of the public functions as they ARE, bugs included),
   commit them separately (`test(design): characterize <module>`), and
   only then refactor.
2. **API snapshot**: record the module's public surface before touching it
   (`griffe dump` if available, else `python3 -c "import m; print(sorted(dir(m)))"`
   or the language equivalent). Caution: importing a module to snapshot
   its API executes import-time side effects (network calls, file
   writes, config loading) — run the snapshot inside the worktree's
   venv, never against your own environment.
3. **Execute the plan exactly**: move code, keep the original module as a
   re-exporting facade. No behavior changes, no opportunistic edits, no
   renames beyond the plan.
4. **Verify**: full test suite passes; API snapshot identical; no new
   import cycles (`import-linter` / `dependency-cruiser` if configured).
5. Commit as `refactor(design): split <module> into <new modules>`,
   staging explicit file paths only.

## Git Safety

<!-- shared:git-safety-core start -- byte-identical across the janitor, multipass, and design skills; scripts/check-git-rules-sync.sh enforces it -->
- Never `git stash`, `git clean`, `git reset`, `git rebase`, `git restore`,
  or `git checkout <ref> -- <path>` to alter or clear working-tree state —
  uncommitted tracked work destroyed that way is unrecoverable. A dirty tree
  that is not yours: STOP and report.
- Stage explicit individual file paths only — never `git add .` and never a
  directory add (directory adds sweep in untracked files).
<!-- shared:git-safety-core end -->
- Never push.

## Report

Verdict, reasoning, plan path (if any), gates passed/failed, commits made
(if any). A `cohesive` verdict with zero changes is a fully successful run.
